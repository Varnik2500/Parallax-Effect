# Parallax Effect Web Page

This project demonstrates the parallax scrolling effect using HTML and CSS. The page includes visually engaging layers that move at different speeds to create a sense of depth as the user scrolls.

## Features

- **Parallax Effect**: Layers (background and foreground) scroll at different speeds, creating a 3D-like effect.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using CSS properties like `object-fit` and `flexbox`.
- **Custom Fonts**: Utilizes the `Poppins` font for a clean and modern typography.

## Screenshots

Include a few screenshots of your project to showcase its appearance. For example:
- Full-page view
- Close-up of the parallax effect in action

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the webpage content.
- **CSS**: Styling and implementing the parallax effect.
